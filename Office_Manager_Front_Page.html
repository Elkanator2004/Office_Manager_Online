    <h2>What is Office Manger Online?</h2>
    <p>Office Manager Online is an online platform that helps small companies to manage their business.
        Here the managers register their accounts and can start manage. For now the platform act like a list of the employees at
    the company. You can add and remove from the lists.</p>
    <h3>What can we expect in the future development of Office Manager Online?</h3>
    <p>Our plans for the platform are big but for the moment we can't execute them. We plan to transform it into
    online assistant of the managers that can do everything what the managers need to work. We will add commands for:
    promoting employees, change the information, retirement of an employee, etc.</p>
